[![Swift 5.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.9%2B-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Neighbor-Z/SwiftMTP/)[![Platform: macOS 12.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-macOS%2012.0%2B-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Neighbor-Z/SwiftMTP/releases/latest)[![License: GPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL-green.svg)](https://github.com/Neighbor-Z/SwiftMTP/blob/main/LICENSE)

**SwiftMTP** is a light-weight, modern, Swift-based utility for interacting with MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) devices on macOS. It allows users to browse, manage, and transfer files between a Mac and external devices like Android phones.

Inspired by [OpenMTP](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/), SwiftMTP uses the enhanced backend to provide a consistently high-performance transfer experience while maintaining a compact footprint.

## AI Features (New)

### Overview

SwiftMTP is now **supercharged by AI**, bringing an efficient and innovative intelligence experience to your MTP file management:

- **Natural Language Search**: Find your files naturally like a conversation. Just type what you're looking for, e.g., "Photos of last week" or "Work documents from 2024".
- **Device Info Analysis**: Get smart insights about your device hardware, connectivity status, and potential performance optimizations.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Easily connect/disconnect MTP devices and select specific storage devices.
- **File Browsing**: Deeply navigate through device directories with a native macOS feel with Quick Look preview supported.
- **Bi-directional Transfer**: Import and export files with support for **Drag-and-Drop**.
- **File Operations**: Create new folders, rename and delete files directly on the device.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time transfer progress bars and status indicators.
- **Safe and secure**: No ADB or USB debugging required.
- **Localization**: Multilingual support via `Localizable.xcstrings`.

## Getting Started

### Download

[Release](https://github.com/Neighbor-Z/SwiftMTP/releases/latest)

### Build

#### Prerequisites

* **Xcode 15.0+**
* **macOS 12.0+**

#### Build & Run
1.  ~~Please build Kalam backend first. Refer to `ffi/kalam/native/README.md`. This step will build necessary dynamic libraries (`kalam.dylib` & `libusb.dylib`) and will place them under `lib`.~~ Pre-compiled dylibs have been added. You can also compile them by yourself.
2.  Open `SwiftMTP.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3.  Select your target platform (macOS).
4.  Press Run.

## FAQ

**I got "OpenSession after reset: LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND"**

This could be due to other software occupying MTP sessions or a device connection issue. Please ensure software like *Preview*, *Image Capture*, or *Android File Transfer* is not running. For *Android File Transfer*, even if it's not running in the foreground, there is an *Android File Transfer Agent* in the system background to detect USB MTP device connections in real time and automatically launch the main app. You can exit *Android File Transfer Agent* in *Activity Monitor*. After that, please reconnect or restart your device.

**macOS cannot verify this app?**

This is because the app was not released in the way Apple prefers. Apple requires developers to pay $99 annually for a so-called "security signature". Please go to System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down and allow the app to run. If the problem still exists, please execute the following command in Terminal and try opening the app once again.

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SwiftMTP.app
```
